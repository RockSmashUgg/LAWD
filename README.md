LAWD
====

An ontology for Linked Ancient World Data

The goal of LAWD is to fill in the cracks between the data used and published by projects with a focus on the ancient world and the standard Linked Data vocablary schemes, like Dublin Core, the Open Annotation Collaboration, and CIDOC-CRM. LAWD will accomplishe this by defining just enough new classes and properties to permit the semantic modeling of things like manuscript collation, relating provenance to geography, and prosopography.
